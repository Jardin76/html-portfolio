<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Joe Harding and this is my first Web Development Project. 
  This Project along with others will give me the confidence to make a move into a Web Development position,
  giving me a change in career from my current employment.</p>

  <p>Computers are becoming the future and I want to be a part of it, that is why 
    I have taken steps to learn computers from the beginning due to having no previous
    experience with them.</p>

  <p> My background has been in Construction, Machine Operations, Military Service and also currently as a Train Driver.
